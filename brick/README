1) Install the following libraries as a plugin
to automatically measure the average shear band angle:
- shear_band_angle.*


2) Use the shell scripts batch, batch_AMR, or batch_initial_visc to generate inputfiles for
different refinement levels, deformation modes, internal friction angles
and initial viscosities from the base input files kaus_extension.prm and kaus_compression.prm.

3) Extract the shear band angles for a fixed mesh resolution and varying friction angle
using the script extract_angle to plot the angles with the gnuplot script script_brick_angles.
This script requires the files angles_theory_extension.dat and angles_theory_compression.dat
that contain the theoretical Roscoe, Arthur and Coulomb shear band angles. 

4) Extract the shear band angles for a fixed mesh resolution and varying initial viscosity
using the script extract_angle_visc to plot the angles with the gnuplot script script_brick_angles_initvisc.

5) Plot the shear band angles for AMR with the gnuplot script script_brick_angles_AMR.
