1) Install the following libraries as a plugin
to create a rectangular box geometry with a freely
subducting plate and overriding plate:
- 3Dsubd_temp.* (for the initial temperature of model 2)
- 3Dsubd_compo.* (for the initial compositions of model 2)
- tag_composition.* (for mesh refinement based on compositional fields)
and
- viscoplastic.* 

2) Inspect the initial temperature distribution with the gnuplot script
script_slab_oceanic_T

3) Run the 3D version of subduction model 1 with for the first time step
3D_subduction_1.prm 
or with an adjacent plate with
3D_subduction_1_AP.prm

4) Run the 3D version of subduction model 2 with for the first time step
3D_subduction_2.prm 
and for the subsequent time evolution
restart_3D_subduction_2.prm
