1) Install the following libraries as a plugin
to create a rectangular box geometry with a freely
subducting plate and overriding plate:
- 2Dsubd_temp.* (for the initial temperature of model 2)
- 2Dsubd_compo.* (for the initial compositions of model 2)
- tag_composition.* (for mesh refinement based on compositional fields)
and
- viscoplastic.* 

2) Run the 2D version of subduction model 1 with for the first time step
2D_subduction_1.prm 
and for the subsequent time evolution
restart_2D_subduction_1.prm

2) Run the 2D version of subduction model 2 with for the first time step
2D_subduction_2.prm 
and for the subsequent time evolution
restart_2D_subduction_2.prm
