Nonlinear viscoplasticity in ASPECT: benchmarking and applications to subduction
Glerum, A., Thieulot, C., Fraters, M., Blom, C. and Spakman, W.
Solid Earth Discussions, 2017

The repository includes the following files needed to run the benchmarks and 
3D subduction models with ASPECT v1.5.0:
- Input files (*.prm)
- Source code of the plugins that can be compiled as shared libraries (*.cc and *.h)
Also included are gnuplot scripts (script_*) and data files (*.dat) used in these scripts for
plotting the graphs in the paper.
