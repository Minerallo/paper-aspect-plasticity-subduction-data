Solid Earth Discussions, 2017

The repository includes the following files needed to run the benchmarks and 
3D subduction models with ASPECT v1.5.0:
- Input files (*.prm)
- Source code of the plugins that can be compiled as shared libraries (*.cc and *.h)
Also included are gnuplot scripts (script_*) and data files (*.dat) used in these scripts for
plotting the graphs in the paper.
