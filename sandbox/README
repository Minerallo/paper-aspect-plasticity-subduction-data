1) Install the following libraries as a plugin:
- viscoplastic.*

2) Use sandbox.prm to compute the first timestep.

3) Restart the sandbox model with different parameters
for solving and refining with restart_sandbox.prm.

4) Create paraview images and movies with 
$ ./pvbatch sandbox_postprocess.py
(You might need to change the directory/file names.)

5) The average number of total degrees of freedom can be computed with
grep free restart_sandbox/opla | awk 'BEGIN{FS=" "}{print $6}' | awk 'BEGIN{sum=0;count=0}{gsub(",", "");sum=sum+$1;count=count+1}END{print sum/count}'
