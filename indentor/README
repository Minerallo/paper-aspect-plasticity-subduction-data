1) Install the following libraries as a plugin
to create a box geometry with two different boundary
conditions on the top boundary:
- boxaddbi.*
- T_boxaddbi.*
- c_boxaddbi.*
and
- viscoplastic.*

2) Run ASPECT with the input files:
- rough_indentor.prm
- smooth_indentor.prm

3) Extract the pressure along the top boundary of the domain with
the ParaView (v 5.4) script with:
$ ./pvbatch extract_surface_pressure.py

4) Plot surface pressure with gnuplot script:
- script_indentor

5) Compute velocity and pressure errors compared to the analytical solution
   with
$ python compute_error.py
and then providing the directory in which the file point_values.txt is contained.
