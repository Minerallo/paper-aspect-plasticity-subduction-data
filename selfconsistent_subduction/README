To run the selfconsistent subduction benchmark
of Schmeling et al. 2008 case 1 and 3:

1) Compile additional plugins:
- slab_tip_trench_position.*

2) Create input files and submit jobs:
case 1:
$ ./batch_1 
case 3:
$ ./batch_3
- run_batch is called by batch_* to submit the job to the scheduler

3) Postprocess slab tip data:
$ gnuplot script_slab_tip_depth_1_3
