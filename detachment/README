1) Install the following libraries as a plugin:
- viscoplastic.*

2) Run the slab detachment benchmark with the input file detachment.prm. 
This requires the input file for the initial particle locations called initial_particle_location.dat.

3) Postprocessing of the run is by computing the necking width over time based on the particle positions.
$ ./pp_necking.sh

4) Plot the necking width over time with the gnuplot script script_detachment_necking_width.
NB: I've not included the original data of Schmalholz (2011). This data can be obtained from the original author.
